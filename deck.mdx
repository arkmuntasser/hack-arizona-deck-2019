import { Appear } from 'mdx-deck'

Goals for our Component Library

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Tightly integrated with our CMS.</li>
    <li>Provide a better experience for our developers.</li>
    <li>Improve code quality and accessibility on our sites.</li>
    <li>Give us a SaaS front end to match our SaaS back end.</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

Tightly integrateed with our CMS.

Our CMS is a closed-source proprietary product.

---

Code examples are NOT production ready.

# Links

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Links are easy!"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/link-example-basic.html")}
  lang="html"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
/>

---

But it's missing attributes like:

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>target</li>
    <li>rel</li>
    <li>title</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

Components can and should be used to enforce best practices/accessibility.

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="hyperlink component"
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/hyperlink.vue")}
  lang="html"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
  steps={[
    {},
    { range: [15, 18], notes: "A prop to pass through our link object from the CMS" },
    { range: [20, 33], notes: "Some computed properties to get our attribute values" },
    { range: [2, 9], notes: "We render a simple anchor with all attributes in place" }
  ]}
/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Instead of writing this..."
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/link-example-bad.html")}
  lang="html"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
/>

---

<CodeSurfer
  title="Devs can write this..."
  code={require("!raw-loader!./snippets/link-example-good.html")}
  lang="html"
  showNumbers={false}
  dark={false}
/>
